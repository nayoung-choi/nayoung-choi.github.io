# Nayoung Choi

Hello ü§ù, I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [{UNIV. DEPT.}](www.) and [{LAB.}](www.), advised by [{PROF.}](www.). My research interest broadly lies in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Information Retrieval (IR)**. I want to contribute to making AI technology interpretable, practical, and social-friendly. Before beginning my Ph.D., I worked as an AI/ML Engineer at [NAVER](https://navercorp.com/), a Korean search engine. I did my Master's at [Digital Analytics](https://computing.yonsei.ac.kr/eng/eng2_2_d.php) at [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/) in Korea, advised by Prof. [Min Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Wu4DqmEAAAAJ&hl=en). My Bachelor's was in [Library and Information Science](https://lis.skku.edu/eng_lis/index.do) from [Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu/eng/index.do) in Korea.
