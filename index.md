# Nayoung Choi

Hello ü§ù, I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [{UNIV. DEPT.}](www.), advised by [{PROF.}](www.) at [{LAB.}](www.). I am currently living in {ADDR1}, {ADDR2}, {COUNTRY}. My research interest broadly lies in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Information Retrieval (IR)**. I want to contribute to making AI technology interpretable, practical, and social-friendly. Before starting my Ph.D., in South Korea, I worked as an AI/ML Engineer at [NAVER](https://navercorp.com/) Search. I earned my Master's degree in [Digital Analytics](https://computing.yonsei.ac.kr/eng/eng2_2_d.php) from [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/), where I was advised by Prof. [Min Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Wu4DqmEAAAAJ&hl=en). My Bachelor's degree is in [Library and Information Science](https://lis.skku.edu/eng_lis/index.do) from [Sungkyunkwan University](https://www.skku.edu/eng/index.do).
